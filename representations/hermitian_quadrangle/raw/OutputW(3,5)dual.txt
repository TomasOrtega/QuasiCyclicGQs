The parity check matrix for the dual of W(3,5) minus a spread is a 5b x 
6b matrix, where b is 26.

The 1 coordinates of the first row of the circulants in the qx(q+1) rep matrix is given by \
Hrep.

The length of the code is 156 and the check matrix has rank 
91, so the full code has dimension 65.

There is a generator matrix for the subcode of the form (P | id) where P is quasi cyclic 
2b x 4b matrix, whose first rows are in the matrix Pbin.

The subcode has dimension 52 so the rate is 0.3333333333333333.
